# HarderCombatShrines

This mod makes changes the Combat Shrine to be a repeatable shrine.  Be careful though because each use of the shrine should spawn harder enemies!

---

## What this does in detail

- Limit of 1 use on Combat Shrine usage was removed.

- Every invoke of the shrine will now increase the credits available to the director.  Should make furhter uses of a combat shrine higher risk/higher reward.

### Installation Guide

- Copy `HarderCombatShrines.dll` to your "Risk Of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins" folder.  You can also search for and install the mod with r2modman.

- The mod should only need to be installed on the host.
